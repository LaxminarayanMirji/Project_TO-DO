**Project_TODO Description**

Project_TODO is a web-based task management application built using the Django framework with HTML and CSS for the frontend. It allows users to manage their to-do lists efficiently by enabling them to add, track, and mark tasks as completed. The main goal of the application is to help users stay organized by maintaining a clear list of tasks and removing completed ones from view.

**Key Features:**
- **Task Creation:** Users can add tasks by entering a description, which are then saved in the database.
- **Mark as Done:** Once a task is completed, users can mark it as "done." This changes its status visually, allowing users to distinguish between active and completed tasks.
- **Task Removal:** Completed tasks can be removed from the list to keep the to-do list clean and up-to-date.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are stored in a database (SQLite by default in Django), ensuring that they persist even after the page is refreshed or the application is closed.

**How It Works:**
1. The user visits the homepage, where they can view a list of all tasks.
2. To add a task, the user enters a description and submits it.
3. Once a task is completed, the user can mark it as done.
4. Completed tasks are visually updated or removed from the list, ensuring a tidy task list.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** Django (Python framework) to handle application logic and database operations.
- **Frontend:** HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and Django templates for rendering dynamic content.
- **Database:** SQLite (default with Django) to store tasks.

**Benefits:**
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Helps users stay organized and track progress by clearly marking completed tasks.
- Can be extended with additional features such as due dates, user authentication, and priority levels.

Project_TODO is a basic but practical application that can be expanded based on individual needs, providing an efficient way to manage tasks and increase productivity.
